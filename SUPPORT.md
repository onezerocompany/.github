# OneZero Support

### New Features & Bugs
When reporting a bug or suggesting a new feature to one of our projects, make sure to open an issue on that repository. There are templates provided to help you file a bug report or a feature request correctly.
> Before opening an issue, please make sure to read our [contributing guideline](https://github.com/onezerocompany/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### For our open-source packages & frameworks:
When trying to get help for one of our repositories, please look at the 'Discussions' tab on that repository. That is where the community of a repository chats about anything related to the project. There you most likely will find one of the project maintainers or someone from the community that can answer your question.

### For our apps
In case you are using one of our apps from the App Store or Google Play Store, most likely, the app has a dedicated button for support within its settings page. If for some reason, that does not work, you can always reach us at the following socials: 

- Email -> [support@onezero.company](mailto:support@onezero.company)
- Twitter ->[@onezerocompany](https://twitter.com/onezerocompany)
